# Contribution Guidelines

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Commits

Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.  
Use the following format:  
| [RESOURCE](LINK) | DESCRIPTION.  
Keep descriptions short (<80 characters is the best).  
End descriptions with a full stop.  
Make an individual commit for each ressource.  
Order projects alphabetically.  
Consolidate multiple commits.  
Check your spelling and grammar.  

## Pull Requests

Use imperative (e.g. add instead of added/adding) in the PR title.  
Include awesome list name(s), categories and a link to the open source project page in the description.  
Add short description in your Pull Request of why the project/resource is awesome.  

## Issues

Discussion, questions and bug reports only.  
If you are sure software meets the guidelines, create a Pull Request (see above).  
Check spelling and grammar.  
Suggestions for improvements to existing structure are welcome.
